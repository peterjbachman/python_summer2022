## 1. write the following functions
## 2. write a unittest class to test each of these functions once
## 3. Run it in this script

## Raising errors is more common when developing ------------------------

## These functions all take a single string as an argument.
## Presumably your code won't work for an int
## raise a built-in (or custom!) exception if fed an int


## make all characters capitalized
def shout(txt):


## reverse all characters in string
def reverse(txt):


## reverse word order in string
def reversewords(txt):


## reverses letters in each word
def reversewordletters(txt):


## optional -- change text to piglatin.. google it!
def piglatin(txt):



## Try/catch is more common when using
## someone else's code, scraping, etc. -----------------------------------

## Loop over this string and apply the reverse() function.
## Should throw errors if your exceptions are being raised!
## Write a try/catch to handle this.
